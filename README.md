## Data Structures
There are two data structures included into the project design to help with the
assignment. See dataStructures/interfaces/ for the header information of these
structures.

* **Hashmap** - This is for anything that needs to retrieve a value based on a key.

* **List** - The list is design to have pushfront, pushback capabilities. For the most part,
you can stick with an array or even a QueueC (FIFO) which are more robust.

## General Libraries
/lib/interfaces

* **CommandHandler** - CommandHandler is what interfaces with TOSSIM. Commands are
sent to this function, and based on the parameters passed, an event is fired.
* **SimpleSend** - This is a wrapper of the lower level sender in TinyOS. The features
included is a basic queuing mechanism and some small delays to prevent collisions. Do
not change the delays. You can duplicate SimpleSendC to use a different AM type or
possibly rewire it.
* **Transport** - There is only the interface of Transport included. The actual
implementation of the Transport layer is left to the student as an exercise. For
CSE160 this will be Project 3 so don't worry about it now.

## Noise
/noise/

This is the "noise" of the network. A heavy noised network will cause issues with
packet loss.

* **no_noise.txt** - There should be no packet loss using this model.

## Topography
/topo/

This folder contains a few example topographies of the network and how they are
connected to each other. Be sure to try additional networks when testing your code
since additional ones will be added when grading.

* **long_line.topo** - this topography is a line of 19 motes that have bidirectional
links.
* **topo.txt** - A slightly more complex connection
